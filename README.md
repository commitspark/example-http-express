# Commitspark Example: Expose the Commitspark GraphQL API over HTTP using Express

This repository contains example code for [Commitspark](https://commitspark.com), the workflow-first Content Management
System based on Git and GraphQL.

---

If you want to expose the GraphQL endpoint and schema generated by Commitspark over HTTP,
the Commitspark GraphQL library can be wrapped in a web server such as [Express](https://expressjs.com). This
repository here holds an example implementation of such a server, configured to manage content in a GitHub-based content
repository.

In case you simply want to work with content in your own JavaScript- or TypeScript-based application,
you may be better off by running queries and mutations directly against the 
[Commitspark GraphQL library](https://github.com/commitspark/graphql-api), without first going through HTTP.
If this is the case, this example here is not relevant for you.

## Starting the Commitspark Express server

1. Run `npm install`
1. Obtain a GitHub "personal access token (classic)" according to the
   [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#authenticating-with-graphql)
   from [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens). Make sure to select the top-level scope `repo`.
1. Get the repository owner and repository name for your **content** repository.

   For example, a repository at `https://github.com/my-org/my-content-repository` has owner `my-org` and
   repository name `my-content-repository`.
1. Copy `.env.dist` to `.env` and fill in your repository owner, name, and GitHub access token.
1. Compile your code with `npm run build` (and do so again after every code change).
1. Run your server with `npm run start`.

The GraphQL endpoint is then available under [http://localhost:3000/main/graphql](http://localhost:3000/main/graphql)
and the generated GraphQL schema as plaintext under
[http://localhost:3000/main/schema](http://localhost:3000/main/schema) (where `main` is the name of a valid branch
in your **content** repository).
